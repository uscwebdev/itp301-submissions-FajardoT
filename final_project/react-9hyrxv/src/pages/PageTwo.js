        <h1>Artists' Hits to Check Out First</h1>
        <p>
          Check out some of the artists' top hits that will give you an idea of
          their style and flow. Although just a snippet of their talent, I
          believe these songs are able to capture their essence in the Latin
          Trap genre.
