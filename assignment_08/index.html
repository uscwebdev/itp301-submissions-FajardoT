      		<h2>Proposal</h2>
      <!-- {/* topic */} -->
	      <p>
	        <strong>Topic:</strong> My website would be similar to other music
	        streaming platforms where I would offer playlists and reccomendations
	        for listeners trying to find a new artists to follow.
	      </p>

	      <!-- {/* audience */} -->
	      <p>
	        <strong>Audience:</strong> My audience would primarily target those
	        interested in Spanish Trap music as those are the artists I am currently
	        most familar with. Additionally, they would be people who don't
	        necessarily know the artists' catalogues and instead are trying to see
	        where to start.
	      </p>

	      <!-- {/* design and color scheme */} -->
	      <p>
	        <strong>Design and Style:</strong> I want my color scheme to be
	        monochromatic with little deviation from the Golden Rod Color. The
	        primary color would be Golden Rod with text being white and and thinking
	        about using black for when buttons are being hovered over/pressed.
	      </p>
	      <p>List of Websites I will like to take inspiration from...</p>
	      <ul>
	        <li>
	          <a href="https://open.spotify.com/" target="_blank">
	            Spotify
	          </a>
	        </li>
	        <li>
	          <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/browse" target="_blank">
	            Apple Music
	          </a>
	        </li>
	        <li>
	          <a href="https://music.youtube.com/" target="_blank">
	            Youtube Music
	          </a>
	        </li>
	      </ul>
	      <!-- {/* sections */} -->
	      <p>
	        <strong>Sections:</strong> I am currently thinking of having three
	        sections for the webpage. They would be the main page which would act
	        like a gallery of artists that the visitor can hover and click over for
	        more info about them and give them the option to go to another one of
	        the site's pages.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	        The second page technically is custom for each featured artist but would
	        provide the same funciton. It would list their biggest hits as well as
	        their past works. In addition to this, it would include various
	        clips/videos that would be related to their creative process such as
	        interviews/podcasts that would help offer insight as to who they are as
	        a person/persona.
	      </p>

	      <p>
	        The final section would be a library of curated playlists that are
	        organized based on "moods" that the listener might be looking for. They
	        would also be seperated by the artist instead of a few lists of the
	        overall genre.
	      </p>

	      <!-- {/* extras */} -->

	      <p>
	        <strong>Extras:</strong> Currently the extras would involve some music
	        videos from the artists for a select number of songs. Additionally, I
	        would want to have the background change while the user scrolls down to
	        either a video or image of the partiuclar time the song/album they're
	        looking at released.
	      </p>
